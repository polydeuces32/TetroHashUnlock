# 🚨 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ❌ **Current Issue: 404 "Application not found"**

Your Railway deployment is returning a 404 error, which means the service isn't running properly.

### **🔍 What I Fixed:**

✅ **Simplified Dockerfile** - Removed complex configurations  
✅ **Removed railway.toml** - Let Railway auto-detect  
✅ **Added Procfile** - Backup configuration  
✅ **Fixed database initialization** - For gunicorn startup  
✅ **Fixed port handling** - Proper Railway port usage  

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Fix:**

### **Step 1: Check Railway Deployment Status**
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Go to your project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Check if the latest deployment is **"Running"** or **"Failed"**

### **Step 2: If Deployment Failed**
- Click on the failed deployment
- Check the **build logs** for errors
- Look for any error messages

### **Step 3: If Deployment is Running but 404**
- Click on the **service** (not deployment)
- Check the **logs** tab
- Look for any runtime errors

### **Step 4: Redeploy**
- Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Deploy Latest"**
- Watch the build process
- Check if it succeeds this time

## 🐳 **Expected Build Process:**

### **What Should Happen:**
1. **"Using Dockerfile"** (not Nixpacks)
2. **Docker build successful**
3. **Service starts with gunicorn**
4. **Database initializes**
5. **Service shows "Running"**

### **What to Look For:**
- ✅ **"Using Dockerfile"** in build logs
- ✅ **"Database initialized"** in runtime logs
- ✅ **"TetroHashUnlock API Server ready for gunicorn"**
- ✅ **Service status: "Running"**

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Still using Nixpacks**
- **Solution**: Railway should now auto-detect Dockerfile

### **Issue 2: Port binding errors**
- **Solution**: Fixed with proper `$PORT` usage

### **Issue 3: Database not initialized**
- **Solution**: Added init_db() for gunicorn

### **Issue 4: Service not starting**
- **Solution**: Simplified Dockerfile and added Procfile

## 🌐 **Test Your Deployment:**

Once running, test these URLs:
- **Main game**: `https://tetrohashunlock-production.up.railway.app/`
- **API health**: `https://tetrohashunlock-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

## 🚀 **Deploy Now:**

**Go to Railway and redeploy!** The simplified configuration should work better! 🐳✨

**Check the deployment status and logs to see what's happening!**
