# 🐳 Docker Deployment - Railway Fixed!

## ✅ **New Approach: Docker-Based Deployment**

I've switched to a Docker-based approach which should be much more reliable on Railway.

### **🔧 What Changed:**

✅ **Added Dockerfile** - Clean Python 3.10 environment  
✅ **Removed Procfile** - Railway will use Docker instead  
✅ **Simplified requirements.txt** - Exact versions only  
✅ **Added .dockerignore** - Optimized build process  
✅ **Updated server.py** - Better Docker compatibility

## 🚀 **Deploy Now (Docker Version)**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway**
- Visit: https://railway.app
- Go to your existing project

### **Step 2: Redeploy**
- **Click "Deployments" tab**
- **Click "Redeploy"** or **"Deploy Latest"**
- Railway will now use Docker instead of Nixpacks

### **Step 3: Watch the Build**
- **Docker build should succeed** now
- **No more Python environment conflicts**
- **Clean, isolated environment**

## 🐳 **Docker Configuration**

### **Dockerfile Features:**
- ✅ **Python 3.10-slim** base image
- ✅ **System dependencies** installed
- ✅ **Non-root user** for security
- ✅ **Gunicorn** for production
- ✅ **Optimized caching** layers

### **Build Process:**
1. **Install system dependencies** (gcc)
2. **Install Python packages** (Flask, gunicorn)
3. **Copy application code**
4. **Create non-root user**
5. **Start with gunicorn**

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After redeployment with Docker:
- ✅ **Build successful** (Docker approach is more reliable)
- ✅ **Service running** status
- ✅ **Live URL** working
- ✅ **Game accessible** in browser

---

## 🌐 **Your Game Will Be Live At:**

Railway will give you a URL like:
**`https://tetrohashunlock-production.up.railway.app`**

---

## 🚀 **Deploy Now!**

**Go back to Railway and redeploy!** The Docker approach should work much better than the previous Nixpacks approach! 🐳✨

**Docker is more reliable and Railway handles it better!**
