# TetroHashUnlock v2.0 — Grid Stability Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

The ASCII Tetris grid has been significantly improved for stability and robustness. The grid now handles edge cases, corruption, and maintains consistent dimensions throughout gameplay.

## ✅ Stability Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Stable Line Clearing Algorithm**
**Before:** Used `del` and `insert` operations that could cause grid corruption
```python
# OLD - Unstable
del self.grid[y]
self.grid.insert(0, [' ' for _ in range(WIDTH)])
```

**After:** Creates new grid and rebuilds it safely
```python
# NEW - Stable
new_grid = []
for y in range(HEIGHT):
    if all(cell != ' ' for cell in self.grid[y]):
        lines_cleared += 1
    else:
        new_grid.append(self.grid[y])
while len(new_grid) < HEIGHT:
    new_grid.insert(0, [' ' for _ in range(WIDTH)])
self.grid = new_grid
```

### 2. **Grid Validation System**
- **`validate_grid()`** - Checks grid integrity and fixes corruption
- **`create_empty_grid()`** - Creates stable empty grids
- **`reset_grid()`** - Safely resets grid to clean state

### 3. **Enhanced Collision Detection**
- **Bounds checking** before collision tests
- **Safe coordinate validation** for all piece positions
- **Grid integrity checks** during collision detection

### 4. **Robust Piece Locking**
- **Pre-lock validation** to ensure grid stability
- **Bounds checking** before locking pieces
- **Corruption detection** with automatic recovery

### 5. **Safe Grid Rendering**
- **Grid validation** before each display
- **Safe copying** of grid data for rendering
- **Corruption recovery** during display

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### **Grid Stability Test Suite**
- ✅ Initial grid creation and validation
- ✅ Line clearing stability
- ✅ Grid corruption recovery
- ✅ Collision detection with stable grid
- ✅ Piece locking with bounds checking
- ✅ Stress testing with multiple clearings

### **Test Results**
```
🎊 ALL STABILITY TESTS PASSED! 🎊
✅ Grid creation and validation working
✅ Line clearing maintains stability
✅ Corruption recovery working
✅ Collision detection stable
✅ Piece locking stable
✅ Stress test passed - grid remains stable through multiple clearings
```

## 🔧 Key Methods Added

### **`create_empty_grid()`**
```python
def create_empty_grid(self):
    """Create a stable empty grid"""
    return [[' ' for _ in range(WIDTH)] for _ in range(HEIGHT)]
```

### **`validate_grid()`**
```python
def validate_grid(self):
    """Validate grid integrity and fix if corrupted"""
    if len(self.grid) != HEIGHT:
        print("⚠️ Grid height mismatch, fixing...")
        self.grid = self.create_empty_grid()
        return False
    
    for i, row in enumerate(self.grid):
        if len(row) != WIDTH:
            print(f"⚠️ Row {i} width mismatch, fixing...")
            self.grid[i] = [' ' for _ in range(WIDTH)]
    
    return True
```

### **`reset_grid()`**
```python
def reset_grid(self):
    """Reset the grid to empty state"""
    self.grid = self.create_empty_grid()
    self.score = 0
    self.game_over = False
```

## 🛡️ Corruption Prevention

### **Automatic Recovery**
- Grid corruption is automatically detected and fixed
- Visual warnings when corruption is found
- Graceful recovery without game crashes

### **Bounds Checking**
- All piece operations check bounds before execution
- Safe coordinate validation for all grid operations
- Prevention of out-of-bounds access

### **Memory Safety**
- Safe copying of grid data for rendering
- Prevention of memory leaks during line clearing
- Consistent grid dimensions throughout gameplay

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### **Efficient Line Clearing**
- O(n) complexity for line clearing
- No repeated array operations
- Single-pass grid reconstruction
